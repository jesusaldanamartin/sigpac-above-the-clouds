### Objectives
The main objective of this Masterâ€™s Thesis is to develop a cloud-based application that automatically validates land cover classification models using geospatial data and performance metrics as described in [3]. The aim is to optimize the execution of the script in the cloud, facilitate data storage, and provide an interactive web interface for visualizing and analyzing the results. In this dissertation we offer an scalable, optimized standardized application that can validate a classification raster with true ground data , giving insights on how well the machine learning classification model has performed. The application will receive the classification raster and the vectorial data as inputs the objective is to let the users upload their own data. The
specific objectives are as follows:

##### 1) Application Development:
1.1 Creation of a web interface for data visualization and analysis.
1.2 Implementation of the backend using cloud services.
1.3 Integration of Python scripts for geospatial processing and model validation.

##### 2) Optimization and Scalability:
2.1 Design of a scalable cloud architecture.
2.2 Implementation of strategies to optimize costs and resources.

##### 3) Deployment:
3.1 Configuration of the deployment environment in the cloud.
3.2 Automation of the deployment and update process. As parallel objectives we would like to do a deep analysis on the different cloud platforms bringing a comparison between tools, usability and cost.
